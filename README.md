# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my solutions to the advent of code 2023.

This is my first year participating, and I want to use it as an
opportunity to learn Rust more in depth, so I'll try to solve as much
as possible using Rust, otherwise I'll probably fallback to TS or JS when
I get stuck.
